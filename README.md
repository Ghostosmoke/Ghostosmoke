## 🧠 What I Do

I build **offline AI applications** and infrastructure-aware systems with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and real hardware constraints.

**Main areas:**

* 🎙️ Speech-to-Text systems (Whisper, Faster-Whisper)
* 🤖 Local LLM applications (Ollama)
* 🖥️ Desktop apps with real UX (PyQt6)
* ⚙️ Linux, Docker, DevOps & system administration

I enjoy working close to the system level, where **software meets hardware**.
